        "description": "<p><b>Munay-Ki, Rites of the Ancient Inkan Shamans~~Becoming Homo Luminous<\/b><\/p> <p>The Munay-Ki (pronounced Moon Eye Key) are the nine great rites of the medicine way. The word munay means \"I love you\" or \"be as thou art.\" <b>The Munay-Ki are the nine gates that heal us and transform our human energy field into that of \"homo luminous.\"<\/b> The prophecies of the Ancient Americas speak about a new human appearing on the planet—one who lives free of fear and resides in his or her transcendent nature. The Munay-Ki are the codes for the new human. They are delivered in the form of energetic transmissions. Until recently, the nine initiations of the Munay-Ki have only been available to the high wisdom keepers of the Americas. As we awaken from the cultural trance that we are born into and access our free will, we are empowered to “dream the world into being.”<\/p> <p>This means that we can shed the past and put an end to the nightmare scenarios that we have unconsciously created. <b>This will enable us to transform our lives and our society into a beautiful paradise on earth.<\/b><\/p> <p>It is recommended that you read <b>Shaman, Healer, Sage<\/b>—<b>How to Heal Yourself and Others with the Energy Medicine of the Americas<\/b> by Alberto Villoldo ISBN[masked] prior to class.<\/p> <p><b>Vickie Penninger is a Mesa Holder in the Inkan lineage.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>***<\/b> <b>Munay-Ki II<\/b><\/p> <p>The second class will cover <b>the second three rites<\/b> —the Seer’s Rite, the Day Keeper Rite, and the Wisdom Keeper Rite.<\/p> <p><b>IV.<\/b> <b>The Seer Rite<\/b> awakens and enhances your intuition so that you can perceive the invisible world of energy with an awakened heart and mind.<\/p> <p><b>V.<\/b> <b>The Day Keeper Rite<\/b> connects you to ancient stone altars and sacred places throughout the world. It brings healing and balance and connects you with the aspects of the Divine Feminine.<\/p> <p><b>VI.<\/b> <b>The Wisdom Keeper<\/b> <b>Rite<\/b> connects you to the sacred mountains – honored places where human and divine meet. This rite enables you to step outside of linear time and connects you with the aspects of the Divine Masculine.<\/p> <p>Participants in this class will learn how to gift the rites to others and will receive these rites in sacred ceremony.<\/p> <p><b>Pre-requisites<\/b> for this class is <b>completion of the Munay-Ki First Class<\/b>. Attendance is limited due to the intensity of the class and the personal attention required for each student.<\/p> <p><b>INVESTMENT: $90.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>TO REGISTER<\/b>: Please send a <b>$40 non-refundable deposit<\/b> <b>by May 11th<\/b>, <b>2016<\/b> to Vickie Penninger by PayPal accessed through <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thereikichannel.com\">www.thereikichannel.com<\/a> or by mailing a check to 711 Kimbrough Street, Raleigh, NC 27608.<\/p> <p><i>Please note that RSVPs for this meetup take place from multiple sources and therefore the RSVPs that you see on this particular meetup may not reflect the actual number of people attending.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Vickie Penninger, Sparkling Crystal Dreamer, Healing Facilitator, is a Shamanic Practitioner and Mesa Holder in the Inca Tradition.  She is a Reiki Master\/Teacher, Archangelic Light Master Practitioner &amp; Instructor, Crystal Energy Therapist, Quantum Clearing Practitioner and ThetaHealer.<\/b><\/p> <p>Vickie offers private sessions as well as classes in Munay-Ki, Reiki, Archangelic Light, Past Life Regression, Energetic Cord Cutting, Crystal Energy Therapy and more.  Vickie has been teaching since 1997!  Visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thereikichannel.com\">www.thereikichannel.com<\/a> for more information.<\/p>",
