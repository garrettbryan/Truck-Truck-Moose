Then to make it extra special....... we will do the Bokeh!  (This is not a dance, but you can wig while you bokeh.)<\/p> <p>This is always a great technique. It is so much more than just making circles. We are going to play with watercolors, a resist technique and dry ink technique. Then we are going to make each of these techniques into a gorgeous card and add an interesting envelope to mail your card.<\/p> <p>Attention Moms: This is the sort of class you will want to bring your daughters too. They seem to come up with the most wonderful colors and designs. (Sometimes they make me jealous.) I have a supply charge only for them, of $10 with a paying adult.<\/p> <p>Supplies to bring: Trimmer, scissors, favorite adhesive. If you are worried about messing up your nails? Bring your own gloves. (But we are using watercolor.)<\/p> <p>Cost of the class:  $25 or a $25 Stampin Up order.<\/p> <p>If you would like to order in advance please use hostess code: <i><b>PR7AS6EN  <\/b>Our hostess of the month will be grateful. <\/i><\/p> <p><i> Would  you like to be  the Hostess of the Month?  Just ask for details. <\/i><\/p>",

About 50-60 people attend the dance, and the attire is casual. The Triangle Singles Club requires that everyone attending the dance be single (divorced or separated, widowed or never married). All levels of dancing ability are welcome, and you don't have to bring a partner. Non-dancers are welcome, too! There is plenty of seating around the room where you can have conversations with new and old friends. The club is primarily for singles over  40, but people under 40 are welcome. <\/b><\/p> <p><b>This evening, J. R. Holloway will be our DJ. The admission at the door ($7 for dues-paying club members*, $10 for guests) includes:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>• a dance lesson from 8:00-8:30 pm (this week the lesson is Hustle),<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>• dancing to a variety of music provided by our DJ (shag, swing, two-step, waltz, cha cha, freestyle, line and slow dances) from 8:30-11:00 pm, and<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>• light refreshments with beverages.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>After the dance, the night owls may head out to a restaurant for more fun!<\/b><\/p> <p>*Please note that joining this Meetup group is free, but to qualify for the \"club member\" discount admission of $7 vs. the \"guest\" admission fee of $10, you have to purchase an optional $25 annual membership from the Triangle Singles Club at one of the dances.<\/p> <p>Directions to Northbrook Country Club: From Glenwood Avenue, turn onto Lead Mine Road (across from Crabtree Valley Mall and Blue Ridge Road), then make an immediate right at the first traffic light onto North Hills Drive.

        "description": "<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.skysports.com\/f1\/news\/12433\/10564976\/watch-daniel-ricciardos-overtake-of-the-year\">One ridiculously-timed overtake<\/a> aside, we didn't see a whole lot of non-DRS action at Monza - which, there, tends to be okay because it's such a quick race and the cars look great at constant full throttle.  Nico Rosberg took advantage of another poor start from Hamilton to take his 7th victory of the season and 2nd in a row; Hamilton and Vettel followed on the podium.<\/p> <p>Five takeaways from the Italian race:<\/p> <p><b>1. Lewis still hasn't quite gotten over his early-season rash of starting errors.<\/b><\/p> <p>Monza was the 5th time he's taken pole this year only to flub it with a slow getaway.  Mechanical issues notwithstanding, this is basically the only portion of his title defense that has led him astray; he's otherwise driven quite superbly.<\/p> <p>But then again, are these start issues the drivers' fault, or do the Mercedes cars actually have an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.planetf1.com\/news\/hamilton-it-was-not-a-driver-error\/\">Achilles heel in their clutch<\/a>?  Food for thought.<\/p> <p><b>2. Valtteri Bottas showed early podium potential but ultimately fell back into his usual mid-points slot in 6th.<\/b><\/p> <p>He gamely held off Lewis Hamilton's advances for the first 10 laps with that fantastic Mercedes engine, but in doing so, struggled with tyre wear and couldn't hang with the frontrunners much longer.  With Massa's points finish, though, Williams at least snatched back 4th in the Constructors' from Force India.<\/p> <p><b>3. Fernando Alonso continues to be the World Champion Of Letting Everyone Know His Car Is a POS.<\/b><\/p> <p>Towards the end of Monza we were gifted <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=a7Wci2uMvwA\">this gem<\/a> from his radio, which pretty much supplants his \"GP2 engine\" comment last year (at the home race of said engine manufacturer) as one of the better ventings of in-race frustration I have heard to date.  It's not even a quotable worth printing on a t-shirt, it's just the blatant disregard for putting any kind of a pretty face on what continues to be a mildly pathetic narrative.  (\"McLaren are back!! ...in 12th and 14th.\")<\/p> <p>After this transmission he then insisted on pulling into the pits and changing tyres just for the sake of setting fastest lap by a full half-second.  Whee.<\/p> <p><b>4. Felipe Massa will be hanging up the racing gloves at the end of the season.<\/b><\/p> <p>Oh, Felipe.  It's been fun, hasn't it?  He's been largely invisible for the last 5 seasons running, so his retirement doesn't come as much of a surprise, even though he was always an emotional favorite.  I'm sure most of us might remember him for two reasons:<\/p> <p>a) Being 2008 World Champion for all of 12 seconds.  This was also the last time we saw Luis Antonio Massa's smile (which quickly morphed into scenes of something-something-Pussycat-Doll bouncing around uncontrollably).  Since then (and understandably so) his dad's appeared on camera as a perpetual <a href=\"http:\/\/cdn-6.motorsport.com\/static\/img\/mgl\/800000\/810000\/813000\/813500\/813586\/s8\/f1-chinese-gp-2009-luis-antonio-massa-father-of-felipe-massa-scuderia-ferrari.jpg\">grumpypants<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Pretty sure Timo Glock is still receiving <a href=\"http:\/\/www.f1fanatic.co.uk\/2015\/11\/11\/glock-answers-fans-on-hamilton-and-brazil-2008\/\">annual fruitbaskets<\/a> from Ron Dennis.<\/p> <p>b) The 2011 season during which he collided with Lewis Hamilton in what felt like every single race.  It was truly uncanny how many times they found one another on track and proceeded to have quarrels over the same racing line.<\/p> <p><b>5. Jenson Button, too, will be hanging up the racing gloves at the end of the season..<\/b><\/p> <p>..but, like <a href=\"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8jdlkTjLFGE\/hqdefault.jpg\">Milton<\/a>, will still be receiving a paycheck thanks to an interestingly structured 2-year contract extension that maybe will\/maybe won't see him back in the car <a href=\"http:\/\/blackflag.jalopnik.com\/jenson-button-is-definitely-not-retiring-but-he-wont-ra-1786150030\">\"if circumstances require\"<\/a>.  Meaning, perhaps, if Fernando gets weary of things like being told a Haas might catch him to take away his hard-earned 14th place, and walks off the job.. those kinds of circumstances.<\/p> <p>On the bright side, we will get to see Stoffel Vandoorne back in the car, which will definitely not be a bad thing.  His points-paying performance in Bahrain this year was exemplary given the shortcomings of his machinery, and he's proven himself deserving of a race drive.<\/p> <p>From the full-throttle delights of Monza to Singapore's twisting confines we proceed.  After the Mercs' mutual momentum swings, we should consider ourselves lucky that the drivers' championship is this close - 2 points! - with seven races left.  Ferrari and Red Bull duking it out for that remaining podium position will likely be our main source of entertainment, and with the walls being close we might see a safety car or two bunch up the field.<\/p> <p>7:30am pre-race, 8am wheels up.  Join us for the blinding million-mega-watt floodlights of Singapore!<\/p>",
